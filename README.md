# Diary1

Simple, public diary app repository. Currently a static front-end with `index.html`.

Getting Started
- Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server.

Develop
- Keep assets and pages under the repository root (or `src/` if you add structure).
- Common development cruft is ignored via `.gitignore`.

Notes
- No backend or runtime dependencies are included.
